--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `yellowbook.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your YellowBook.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`listC`** : Lists all contacts.

   * **`addC`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to YellowBook.

   * **`deleteC`**`3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current contact list.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Sample Usage

To better understand the usage of YellowBook, we have provided a usage scenario of YellowBook below. We encourage all first-time users to follow along the to learn how each command works.

1. YellowBook comes with a list of sample contacts and tasks by default.

2. Let's start by listing all the contacts in YellowBook. Type `listC` in the command box and press Enter to execute it. You should see a list of contacts. Try using `listT` to list all the tasks.

3. More to be added

4. As you have have noticed, YellowBook's commands are mnemonically named. A [Command Summary](#command-summary) with these helpful tips can be found below.

5. Now that you are ready, feel free to add your own contacts and tasks to YellowBook!

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [r/REMARK]` can be used as `n/John Doe r/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/LABEL]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `listC`, `listT`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

* Only one keyword is allowed. If more than one keyword is typed, e.g. `copyC CS2103T CS2101`, this will be taken as one
keyword "CS2103T CS2101" and the command will not work.

Example:

* `copyC CS2103T` returns a string of emails of contacts that contain the label `CS2103T`.

## Section 3: Labels

These commands allow you to further organise people and tasks into subgroups depending on the nature of the project you
are working on together.
Whether it be a software engineering module or a business pitch, you can customise every person and task.
With our label feature, managing your numerous projects on the go has just gotten a lot easier.


### Listing all labels: `listL`

Shows a list of all existing labels in the address book.

### Adding a label to a contact/task: `addL`

Adds a label to an existing contact/task in YellowBook. Each contact/task can have multiple labels.
At the same time, the label is added to the label list, shown under the "tags" tab of the app.
This list is unique, meaning each label with a distinct name is only shown once, even if more than one contact/task has the same label.

Multiple labels can be added in the same command.
However, only a maximum of one contact and one task can be labelled within the same command.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
addL is case-sensitive! `cs2103t` and `CS2103T` will be added as separate labels in the tag list.
</div>

Labels must be alphanumeric and one word long.

The following scenarios should not happen for your command to run successfully: 
- Contact/task does not exist
- Contact/task already has the required label
- No label is provided
- No contact/task is provided
- More than one contact or more than one task is specified

Format: `addL c/INDEX t/INDEX l/label_NAME`

Example:

* `addL c/3 t/12 l/CS2103T` will add the label "CS2103T" to the 3rd contact on the contact list and 12th task on the task list.

### Removing a label from a contact/task: `deleteL`

Removes a label from an existing contact/task in YellowBook.

If contact/task is last remaining contact/task with said label, label is removed from the label list.
Otherwise, it is only removed from the specified contact/task label list.

Multiple labels can be deleted in the same command.
However, only a maximum of one contact and one task can be edited within the same command.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
deleteL is case-sensitive! If you try to delete `cs2103t` but type `CS2103T` in your command, 
you will encounter an error as YellowBook will not find a match.
</div>

Labels must be alphanumeric and one word long.


The following scenarios should not happen for your command to run successfully: 
- Contact/task does not exist
- Label does not exist on specified contact/task
- No contact/task is provided
- No label is provided
- More than one contact or more than one task is specified

Format: `deleteL c/INDEX t/INDEX l/label_NAME`

Example:

* `deleteL c/12 t/14 l/CS2101` will remove the label "CS2101" from the 12th contact and 14th task on the task list.

### Delete all contacts and tasks by label: `deleteA`

Delete all contacts and tasks who contain the label(s) specified.

Format: `deleteA LABEL_NAME [MORE_LABEL_NAMES]`

* The label is also deleted.

* The label is case-sensitive, e.g. `cs2103t` will not delete labels named `CS2103T`.

* Multiple labels can be specified.

* If a contact/task has multiple labels, it will not be deleted as long as it has at least one label.
  Instead, the labels will be removed from the contact/task.

The following scenarios should not happen for your command to run successfully:
- Label does not exist
- No label is provided

## Automatic tab switching

Depending on the command you enter, you will see the open tab in the GUI switch automatically.
For example, when using a task-related command, the tab switches to "Task" and the task list is displayed.

The result of the entered command is displayed.
For example, after adding a new contact, the list shown on the GUI is the updated list with your new contact included.

## YellowBook data
### Saving the data

YellowBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

YellowBook data are saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/yellowbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, YellowBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous YellowBook home folder.
